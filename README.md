Solutions for checkio.org


List of solutions for HOME base:

1.Non-unique-elements function.
You are given a non-empty list of integers (X). For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list.
To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

2.Median function.
A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half. In a list where there are an odd number of entities, the median is the number found in the middle of the list. If the list contains an even number of entities, then there is no single middle value, instead the median becomes the average of the two numbers found in the middle. For this mission, you are given a non-empty list of natural numbers (X). With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and find the median.
