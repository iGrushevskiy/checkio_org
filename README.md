Solutions for checkio.org


List of solutions for HOME base:

1.Non-unique-elements function.
You are given a non-empty list of integers (X). For this task, you should return a list consisting of only the non-unique elements in this list.
To do so you will need to remove all unique elements (elements which are contained in a given list only once). When solving this task, do not change the order of the list. Example: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3] 1 and 3 non-unique elements and result will be [1, 3, 1, 3].

2.Median function.
A median is a numerical value separating the upper half of a list of numbers from the lower half. In a list where there are an odd number of entities, the median is the number found in the middle of the list. If the list contains an even number of entities, then there is no single middle value, instead the median becomes the average of the two numbers found in the middle. For this mission, you are given a non-empty list of natural numbers (X). With it, you must separate the upper half of the numbers from the lower half and find the median.

3.Password check function.
Help Nikola develop a password security check module for Sofia. The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols, it has at least one digit, as well as containing one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it.

4.Most wanted letter function.
You are given a text, which contains different english letters and punctuation symbols. You should find the most frequent letter in the text. The letter returned must be in lower case.
While checking for the most wanted letter, casing does not matter, so for the purpose of your search, "A" == "a". Make sure you do not count punctuation symbols, digits and whitespaces, only letters.
If you have two or more letters with the same frequency, then return the letter which comes first in the latin alphabet. For example -- "one" contains "o", "n", "e" only once for each, thus we choose "e".

5.Xs and Os Referee function.
Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D."
A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
